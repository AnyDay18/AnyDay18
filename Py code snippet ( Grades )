 Here's a Python code snippet to take a number from the user and determine if it's zero, positive, or negative using conditional statements: 
Code user_number = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
if user_number == 0:  
print("The number is zero.") 
elif user_number > 0:  
print("The number is positive.") 
else:  
print("The number is negative.") 
To display grades based on user input marks, you can use the following Python code: 
Code user_marks = float(input("Enter the marks obtained: ")) 
if user_marks >= 90:  
grade = "A+" 
elif user_marks >= 80:  
grade = "A" 
elif user_marks >= 70:  
grade = "B+" 
elif user_marks >= 60:  
grade = "B" 
elif user_marks >= 50:  
grade = "C+" 
elif user_marks >= 40:  
grade = "C" 
else:  
grade = "Fail" print(f"Grade: {grade}")
